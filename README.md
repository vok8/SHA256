## SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm

**Language Used:** C++17

- This is the Implemtation of SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm in C++, according to the specification mentioned on the <a href="https://csrc.nist.gov/csrc/media/publications/fips/180/4/final/documents/fips180-4-draft-aug2014.pdf"> NIST Website. </a> <br/>

- The C++ Program of my Implementation, asks the user to enter a String (of length < 2^64) and outputs its Hash Value (calculated using SHA-256).
