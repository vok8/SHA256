## SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm

**Language:** C++17

This is the Implemtation of SHA-256 Hashing Algorithm in C++, according to the specification mentioned on the NIST Website. <br/>

--> The C++ Program of my Implementation, asks the user to enter a String (of length < 2^64) and get its Hash Value (calculated using SHA-256).
